MODBUS TO TRY:

1. Print out the bytes as they are with no memcpy
2. Try the CRC switching highbyte and lowbyte order!
	make sure to change both functions?
3. Use side program to send commands that should be modbus commands
	try reversing endianness or something and the crc bytes (big to little endian)
4. ask eric about the 12V and -12V power thing?
5.
